Implementation of a web application is based user door lock system control.
At this project Microsoft MVC 5.0 is used

Business case: Interface which allows users to open doors and show historical events to extend our user experience beyond classical tags

Background:

In our office we have 2 doors through which people can access. The 1st door is the tunnel and the 2nd door is to enter the office. We want to extend our user experience by giving our users a front-end (either web or mobile) which allows people (with the correct security access) to open the doors. Currently the doors are only to be opened if you have a “tag” that is authorized.

Take into account:

1. To deliver a seamless user experience there should be an input screen that allows to define the doors of your property and the users which have access

2. A screen that allows the user to press “Open door” (doors as added in step 1)

3. Every door open (and/or access denied) event should be available to the user

The user should see a smooth loading bar after pressing the “open door”. If a user doesn’t have access to a certain door an “access denied” screen should be displayed.
